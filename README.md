A total of 335 patients with suspected COVID-19 who did not have any chronic diseases before entering Elazig City Hospital between 01.10.2020 and 01.01.2021 were asked for RT-PCR, CBC and CT scanning at the time of application. A total of 135 of 335 patients were determined to be COVID-19 patients. The PCR test of 121 of these patients was positive, and the PCR tests of other patients were recorded as negative. CT scans of 14 patients with negative PCR tests were performed, and these patients were identified as positive. COVID-19 findings were not found as a result of CT scans in 50 of 135 patients. Both RT-PCR and CT scans of the remaining 200 patients were negative. For each patient, CBC-DIFF(Complete Blood Count with Differential) scattergrams and WBC subgroup values (Neu, Lym, Mon, Bazo, Eos) were obtained with a DXH-800 (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Miami, FL, USA) device. The DXH-800 analyser uses the volume, conductivity, and scatter parameters for controlled flow cytometric analysis of WBC differential detection.
Ethics approval for the study protocol was obtained from the local area heath ethics committee. It is approved by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey with the form number 2021-01-13T13_56_35.
